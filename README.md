# LokkenBot

The Source code of a badly coded Discord Bot

This bot won't be updated again so if you really want to have this bot (I'd strongly reccomend literally any other bot) just copy the source code and create your own instance.

# Files Included:

main.py - the main python script that is run

encode.py - my algorithm for encoding messages

helptext.txt - what the bot should say when asked for help

meme.jpg - where mathsmemes are saved after being requested

pi - the digits of pi

<h3>Special_info</h3>
  
  banned - a list of user IDs of users banned from the 'suggest' command
  
  prefixes - a list of the guilds the bot is in and their prefixes
  
  reddit - the reddit login and application info for the 'mathsmeme' command
  
  token - the bot's token
<h3>dos<h3>
